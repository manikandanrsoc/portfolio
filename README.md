## **🌟 About Me**
I am Manikandan R, a passionate and self-driven cybersecurity enthusiast with a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication. I specialize in Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis, threat detection, and incident response. I recently earned the globally recognized CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification, strengthening my knowledge across core cybersecurity domains, including security architecture, operations, and risk management.

Over the past few years, I have deepened my cybersecurity skills through hands-on projects, virtual labs, and platforms like TryHackMe, where I completed multiple learning paths such as SOC Analyst, Cyber Defense, and Jr Penetration Tester. I also developed real-world projects like an SOC Automation Lab and Active Directory Security Lab, focusing on SIEM, SOAR, and threat hunting operations.

I have practical experience with tools like Splunk, ELK Stack, Wazuh, TheHive, Velociraptor, Wireshark, and EDR/XDR solutions. I am proficient in scripting with Python and automating workflows to improve detection and response processes. My focus is on strengthening enterprise security, detecting adversarial activities, and responding to incidents effectively.

As a fresher, I am excited to begin my professional journey as a SOC Analyst Level 1 or Cybersecurity Analyst, where I can apply my skills in threat defense, security monitoring, and incident handling to help organizations maintain a secure posture.
